# Basics
## Basic Commands
In the running container, try the following statements. What are they doing?

| Command    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| ps  | Determine your shell type    |
| date | Displays the current date     |
| pwd    | Displays the present working directory    |
| ls    | Lists the contents of the current directory    |
| echo    | Prints a string of text, or value of a variable to the terminal    |

## Shebang
    #!/bin/bash
    which bash


# Creating your first bash script
Install the text editor **vim**.

    apt-get update
    apt-get install vim

In your terminal, run the following code:

    vim run_all.sh

---
#!/bin/bash

echo "Today is " \`date`

echo "Enter the path to directory"

read the_path

echo "Your path has the following files and folders: "

ls $the_path

---

    chmod u+x run_all.sh

- chmod modifies the ownership of a file for the current user :u.
- +x adds the execution rights to the current user. This means that the user who is the owner can now run the script.
- run_all.sh is the file we wish to run.

    sh run_all.sh
    bash run_all.sh
    ./run_all.sh
